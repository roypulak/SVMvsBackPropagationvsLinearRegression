The goal of any supervised learning algorithm is to find a function that
best maps a set of inputs to its correct output.Back-propagation is a common method for training a neural network.In machine learning, support
vector machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models with associated
learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. Back-propagation algorithm was to find a way to train a
multi-layered neural network such that it can learn the appropriate internal representations to allow it learn any arbitrary mapping of input
to output.Alongside Multiple linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two or more explanatory variables and a response
variable by fitting a linear equation to observed data. Every value of the
independent variable x is associated with a value of the dependent y.

Objective: Compare the classification results with the following algorithms:
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Back-Propagation (BP)
Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
